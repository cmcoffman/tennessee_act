# Effects of Mandatory College Admissions Testing in Tennessee

### Overview

This project seeks to analyze the effect of mandatory ACT testing in Tennessee in performance and participation rates. 

### Executive Summary

Since ACT testing was made mandatory in Tennessee in 2018 average composite scores have dropped for students accross all socioeconomic classes. This is presumed due to increased participation diluting the pool of self-selected test-takers. In other words, students who lacked interest or motivation to take the test before the mandate are now taking it, lowering the average score. Additionally, data from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission indicated that the decline in college enrollment in Tennessee which stated in 2015 has been unaffected by mandatory ACT testing. While not a comprehensive analysis, these data do not support the ACT increasing college enrollment. Given the out of class time, school resources, and funds used for this program, Tennessee should consider if ACT testing adds value to their students.
